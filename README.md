## 🎬 About the Film

Four successful high school friends—Joaquin, Nigel, Chloe, and Bea—are lured to a mysterious reunion at "The Loft." Trapped in a secluded place, they are forced to confront a dark secret from their past: the bullying and death of their classmate, Abby.

As their carefully constructed lives crumble into madness, they must face the terrifying reality that death is easy, but true **atonement** is hell.
